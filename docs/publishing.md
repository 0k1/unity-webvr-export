# Publishing

## Publishing for Android Chrome

For WebVR content to work with the regular release version of Chrome for Android, users will need to [manually enable WebVR](https://webvr.rocks/chrome_for_android#setup) from `chrome://flags`.

Alternatively, sites can register for a [WebVR Origin Trial token](https://webvr.rocks/chrome_for_android#what_is_the_webvr_origin_trial) which will allows the API to be available for whitelisted origins.
